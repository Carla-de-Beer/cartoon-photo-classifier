# Cartoon-Photo Classifier: Flask Apps

This folder contains the deployment of the cartoon-photo classifier TensorFlow-Keras as either a Flask web app or a Flask API:
  * [Cartoon-Photo Classifier API:](https://github.com/Carla-de-Beer/cartoon-photo-classifier/tree/main/deployment/flask-app-deployment/cartoon-photo-classifier-api) The TensorFlow-Keras cartoon-photo convolutional neural network model exposed as a simple API.
  * [Cartoon-Photo Classifier Web:](https://github.com/Carla-de-Beer/cartoon-photo-classifier/tree/main/deployment/flask-app-deployment/cartoon-photo-classifier-web) The TensorFlow-Keras cartoon-photo convolutional neural network model exposed as a simple web frontend.

# Cartoon-Photo Classifier: Flask Apps

This folder contains the deployment of the cartoon-photo classifier TensorFlow-Keras as either a Flask web app or a Flask API:
  * [Cartoon-Photo Classifier API:](https://github.com/Carla-de-Beer/python-projects/tree/master/flask-projects/keras-model-deployment/cartoon-photo-classifier-web) A TensorFlow-Keras cartoon-photo convolutional neural network model exposed as a simple web frontend.
  * [Cartoon-Photo Classifier Web:](https://github.com/Carla-de-Beer/python-projects/tree/master/flask-projects/keras-model-deployment/cartoon-photo-classifier-web) A TensorFlow-Keras cartoon-photo convolutional neural network model exposed as a simple web frontend.
